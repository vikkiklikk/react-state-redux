# React + TypeScript + Vite

A school project that showcases the usage of a state management solution.
I chose Redux for this as we are using Redux in out internship at SÃ­minn.

I made two slices, one for the counter and one for the to-do list.

The to-do list resets after a refresh but it should be easy to connect to a db or use local storage.
Since the assignment was to showcase the state management I stopped there.

Tailwind for styling
gh-pages for deployment
